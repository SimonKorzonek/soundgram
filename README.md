SOUNDGRAM

Simple social media app - my first project in Python! Populated with some random content, just for presentation. There are endless things that could be added, fixed, and probably some bugs I don't know about.

Used technologies
- Pyhton & Flask
- FlaskSQLAlchemy database
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Functionalities
- System of accounts, followers, posts and messages
- Users can update their info, profile pics and reset their passwords. Passwords are hashed and salted.
- Any user can follow/unfollow any user except him/herself. Info about followers and following can be found in user profile section. Many-to-many database relationships.
- User can upload image/audio/video files with text. Post may be edited or removed by author. Post can be seen, liked or commented by any user. You can filter posts by newest or made by followed users on your homepage
- Primitive private message system. More like e-mail box from 80'
